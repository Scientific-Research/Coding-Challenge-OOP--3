/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car.
Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property); 

2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';

3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';

4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definition of polymorphism ðŸ˜‰!

DATA CAR 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%!

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
